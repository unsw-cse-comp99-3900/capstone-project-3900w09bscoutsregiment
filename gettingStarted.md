Installation if docker fails:

Assuming we have done the steps in [Docker installation] above and things failed. We are going to manually run the frontend and backend.

1. Stop the docker container.

CTRL + c

2. Once the docker container stops navigate to frontend and install the node modules

cd frontend
npm install 3. Navigate to backend and install the node modules

cd ../backend
npm install

# Once the node modules is installed, we can run the backend

npm run dev

4. Open a new terminal and run the frontend

cd capstone-project-3900w09bscoutsregiment/frontend
npm run dev

5. Navigate to localhost:3000

Navigate to local host 3000 and the app should be working correctly.
